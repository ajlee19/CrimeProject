# CrimeProject

Created a unique method of crime data crawling from public news media sources versus standard police report data, and used natural language processing libraries along with machine learning methods to classify whether a sentence in an article has crime data. Transformed those data into coordinates and mapped onto Carto Map and used Django for UI development.
